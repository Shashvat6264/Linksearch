It is about the one truly important philosophical problem: Given the circumstances of our existence, shouldn‚Äôt we just kill ourselves? This is his answer: At first Camus describes those moments in our lives when our ideas about the world suddenly don‚Äôt work anymore, when every daily routine ‚Äî going to work and back ‚Äî and all our efforts seem pointless and misdirected. When one suddenly feels foreign and divorced from this world. In these frightening moments of clarity we feel the absurdity of life. Reason + Unreasonable World = Absurd Life This absurd sensitivity is the result of a conflict. On the one hand we make reasonable plans for our lives, and on the other hand we are confronted with an unpredictable world which does not comply with our ideas. So what is absurd? Being reasonable in an unreasonable world. This is the basic conflict we are confronted with. The tension between our reasonable ideas about the world, which collide with what we actually experience over time.

I needed a tool to solve the technical challenges of managing the Node processes and deploying the application in a very efficient manner.   I chose PM2, which is a handy process management tool for running Node.js applications in production environments. PM2 provides a simple command line interface that makes it easy to get started. This powerful Node module has tools for managing application processes, logging, and more.  In this article, I provide an introduction to PM2, showing why it is such a valuable tool for managing Node.js applications. By way of a reference example application, we show the basic features and commands for using PM2 and give examples of generating configuration files for both running and deploying applications.","language":"en","type":"article","url":"https://keyholesoftware.com/2017/10/30/advanced-node-js-process-management-with-pm2/","provider":"Keyhole Software","author":"Matthew Brown","published":"2017-10-30T17:11:08.000Z","robots":["index","follow","max-image-preview:large","max-snippet:-1","max-video-preview:-1"],"twitter":"@KeyholeSoftware","image":"https://keyholesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/PM2.png","icon":"https://keyholesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Keyhole-Icon-Logo-192x192.png"},{"title":"The Chernobyl Story [Updated & Expanded]","description":"1229614 views on Imgur: The magic of the Internet","language":"en","type":"article","url":"https://imgur.com/a/TwY6q","provider":"Imgur","author":"Imgur","robots":["none"],"copyright":"Copyright 2022 Imgur, Inc.","twitter":"@imgur","image":"https://i.imgur.com/7gCHWj2.jpeg?fb","icon":"https://s.imgur.com/images/favicon-96x96.png"},{"title":"Life is Short","url":"http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html","provider":"paulgraham","icon":"https://ycombinator.com/arc/arc.png"},{"title":"Error","description":"Error","url":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/memcrashed-major-amplification-attacks-from-port-11211/","provider":"Error","image":"Error","icon":"Error"},{"title":"GitHub Survived the Biggest DDoS Attack Ever Recorded","description":"On Wednesday, a 1.3Tbps DDoS attack pummeled GitHub for 15-20 minutes.
